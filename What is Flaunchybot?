Flaunchybot is more than just a cute cat avatar with "big ambitions"—it's an intelligent agent that automates token launches for the Flaunch platform.

 Users interact with it directly on X (formerly Twitter) by tagging @flaunchybot
 and saying "flaunch it," prompting the bot to generate a token based on the context of the replied-to post.

The bot's own token, Flaunchy (FLNCHY), serves as a mascot coin with a total supply of 100 billion tokens, traded primarily on Uniswap V4 on Base.

 FLNCHY embodies the project's goal of fostering a sustainable "meme economy" by promoting fair launches and community-driven value.

 Recent activity shows Flaunchybot actively responding to launch requests, such as creating tokens like "Anime Soar" or "GodCats" directly on Base. 

Flaunch, the underlying protocol, differentiates itself with mechanisms like fixed-price fair launches, automatic buybacks funded by trading fees, and tokenized fee streams as NFTs—ensuring alignment between creators, holders, and traders. 

 Powered by Uniswap V4, these features prevent rugs and encourage long-term growth.
