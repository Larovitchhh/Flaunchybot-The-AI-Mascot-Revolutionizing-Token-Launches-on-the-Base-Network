Fair Launches and Community ImpactTraditional token launches often suffer from sniping bots, unfair distributions, and rug pulls. Flaunchybot addresses this through Flaunch's buy-back system—triggered by every 0.1 ETH in fees—and creator-set revenue shares that fund market buys, creating aligned incentives. 

 This has led to a surge in Flaunch Launchpad coins on Base, with thousands of daily transactions.
