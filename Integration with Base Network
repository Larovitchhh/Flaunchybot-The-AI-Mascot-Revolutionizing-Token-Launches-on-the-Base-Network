Both bots thrive on Base's scalability, enabling low-cost, instant transactions ideal for social-driven DeFi.

 Flaunchybot deploys tokens directly on Base, using Uniswap V4 for liquidity and fair mechanisms to align creators and holders.

 Bankrbot extends this by supporting Base alongside other chains, with fiat on-ramps via Coinbase and features like group chat trading in the Base app. 

Their collaboration shines in Base app group chats: Users can add both bots to discuss launches (Flaunchybot summarizes projects) and execute trades (Bankrbot handles buys/sends). 

 This setup democratizes access, turning casual X interactions into on-chain actions while mitigating risks like unintended token creations through improved AI safeguards.
