In the evolving landscape of decentralized finance (DeFi) on the Base network—an Ethereum Layer 2 solution known for low fees and high throughput—AI agents like @flaunchybot
 and @bankrbot
 are transforming how users interact with tokens, trading, and social-fi applications. 

 Both bots leverage Base's infrastructure for seamless on-chain actions, but they serve distinct roles: Flaunchybot focuses on effortless token launches, while Bankrbot acts as a comprehensive crypto wallet and trading assistant.

 Recently integrated into the Base app's group chats, these agents enable collaborative trading and money transfers without leaving conversations, highlighting their synergy in programmable meme economies.
